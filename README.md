# Survival Pets

## About

Survival Pets is a fun, interactive virtual pet care app that challenges users to nurture and care for  
their digital pets. Users select a starter pet and are responsible for fulfilling its daily needsâ€”feeding, playing, and ensuring the pet's overall well-being. The app's engaging animations and intuitive controls create an emotional connection between the user and their pet, while the realistic difficulty level keeps users on their toes, making the experience both heartwarming and rewarding.

This project was a collaborative effort between Johannes Braun, Alexander Niehaus, Felix Neumayr, and Jonas Wendland as part of our final Capstone Project for the web development bootcamp at neue fische GmbH. Building this app not only sharpened our technical skills but also provided us with a valuable experience of working together as a team to develop a full-stack application from concept to completion.

# Features

Choose Your Pet: Users can select from a variety of virtual pets, each with its own unique looks.

Daily Challenges: Players must meet their pet's daily needs, such as feeding or playing.

Realistic Difficulty: Maintaining the pet's happiness and health requires ongoing attention, providing a rewarding challenge for pet lovers. (For demonstration purposes, the pets' stats decrease more quickly than they would in a live version intended for a larger player base).

# Technologies Used

We used a modern tech stack to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. Below are the core technologies employed in this project:

- React: For building a responsive and interactive user interface using reusable components.
- Next.js: As the framework to handle server-side rendering, optimized performance, and routing for a seamless user experience.
- Styled Components: For modular, component-level styling with a clean and maintainable codebase.
- MongoDB: As the NoSQL database for persisting user and pet data in a scalable, cloud-ready environment.
- Node.js & Express: To handle the backend API, enabling efficient communication between the database and front-end.
- Vercel: Used for hosting and continuous deployment, ensuring quick access and automatic updates after each code push.

# Future Enhancements

We have several exciting ideas for future development, including:

- Additional Pet Types: Introducing more pets with varying needs and personalities.
- Pet Accessories: Allowing users to customize their pets with fun accessories.
- Leaderboard: A competitive feature to show top pet caretakers.
